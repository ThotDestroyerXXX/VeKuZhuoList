It employs 408 people as of April 2024 between its Tokyo, Osaka and Sendai studios. Maruyama's intent was for the film Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner of the World) to be the studio's first release, though the project would not be complete until 2016. By that time, the studio had already co-produced Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope) and Hajime no Ippo: Rising, and released its first original anime—Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance).

The name MAPPA is an acronym for Maruyama Animation Produce Project Association. Maruyama stepped down as president in 2016 to form Studio M2. He was replaced by former Studio 4°C employee Manabu Ootsuka."

Kyoto Animation spent its early years doing finishing work for other companies' productions, but opened its own drawing department in 1986, the year following its establishment as a limited company.

By the mid-90s, the company had developed a strong reputation in the industry, as well as ties to studios such as Gonzo, Shin-Ei Animation, and Sunrise. Kyoto Animation released its first full in-house production—the first Munto OVA—in March 2003, and its first television anime, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, in the summer of the same year.

The company gained worldwide attention on July 18, 2019 when an arson attack destroyed its original studio (known as Studio 1) in Fushimi, claiming the lives of 36 people."

Madhouse primarily did contract work for other studios until the 1990s, when it achieved success independently. Television adaptations of Trigun and Clamp's Cardcaptor Sakura in 1998 were hits domestically and later aired overseas, and the same year director Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue was released as his first of four critically-acclaimed films with the company.

Madhouse remained successful throughout the 2000s and 2010s, adding director Mamoru Hosoda to its roster and releasing numerous popular television anime, including adaptations of Hajime no Ippo, Death Note, and One Punch Man. Maruyama stepped down from his role as president and left the company in June 2011 to start studio MAPPA."

Hikaru Kondou—a former production assistant at Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment) and Telecom Animation Film and producer at Step Eizou—founded the studio in October 2000. The company's name originates from a UFO-shaped table Kondou came across as he was devising the studio's vision. He subsequently acquired the table and named the studio after it.

      At the time of establishment, the studio primarily produced adaptations of novel, manga, and original projects by ASCII Media Works (now Kadokawa), most of which featured wacky comedy and eccentric developments. Following the release of the Kara no Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners) film series, ufotable came into the spotlight.

      Contrary to popular belief, the quality of ufotable shows is due to their unusual degree of production independence, in-house talent, and exceptional organization, rather than having vastly higher budgets than other animation studios.

      As of February 2023, the company employs about 240 full-time staff between its Suginami and Tokushima studios, the latter of which was established in April 2009."
